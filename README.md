# Paris-Subway-Challenge
Visit all the metro station of Paris in the least time possible


## Rules

* The goal is to pass in one day by all the metro stations in Paris.

* You have to go at least once (though not necessarily one) by each of the Paris metro stations intramural, during a day.

* Authorized transportations are: the metro (however, the use of the bus, a car or a taxi, or even a bicycle, is prohibited).

* It is not necessary to browse the metro stations located outside the limits of Paris (it stops at stations with names in "porte ... ..").

* BUT it is not forbidden to leave Paris (eg. by going to the Boulogne Jean Jaurès station, which has an interest).

* If a station is crossed by several lines, it is not necessary (but not prohibited) to go as many times as there are lines that pass by.

* There is no need to stop at each station: cross enough.

* Finally, two stations are considered different if they have different names (including Châtelet is not the same station as Les Halles).
